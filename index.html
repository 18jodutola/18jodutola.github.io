    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Joshua Odutola, I am a year 12 Computer Science student. I also study maths and psychology A-level and play basketball at a high level. This webpage is a portfolio to document my coding projects. 
        I enjoy computer science and I have also studied it at GCSE where I got a grade 9 in the exam.
  </div>

  <div id="pastProjects" class="tab-content">
    <h2>Past Projects</h2>
    <p>I have not worked on very many projects but some that I have done at my old school were: <br>
        -Library database system in SQL <br>
        -Restaurant menu webpage in HTML and CSS<br>
        -calculator in python<br>
        -BMI calculator in Visual Basic<br>
        
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="futureProjects" class="tab-content">
    <h2>Future Projects</h2>
    <p>There are several projects I will be doing this school however I would also like to pursue some other projects in my free time.
        Something I am interested in is creating a rubix rube simulation, possibly as an Artefact for my EPQ. Something else I am interested 
         in is designing a website (using HTML, CSS and Javascript) for a clothes brand my friend has started where customers will be able to 
          browse and purchase clothes. </p>

  <script>
    /*JavaScript for tabs - shows one tab while hiding the others*/
    function showTab(tabId) {
      const tabs = document.querySelectorAll('.tab-content');
      tabs.forEach(tab => {
        tab.classList.remove('active'); /*all tabs start off hidden, this is achieved by removing the class "active"*/
      });

      document.getElementById(tabId).classList.add('active'); /*this adds the class "active" to the tab currently open*/
    }
